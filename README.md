this is the most important proposition/project during which I may be assissted by TUMS
**Pharmacometrics**

"Pharmacometrics is an emerging science defined as the science that quantifies drug, disease and trial information to aid efficient drug development and/or regulatory decisions" as stated by [fda.gov](url).
Corresponding to an attempt made in regards to the development of a "network of eligible processors" , I have decided to develop a platform which assimilates to [https://mgm.ku.edu/](url) applied for computational services aimed towards translational science in biomedical area.

My field of interest "chronic inflammation", which is attributed to malignancies, is explored in extended aspects; namely, identification of available "omics" targets, drug repurposing, and proposing new therapeutic/prophylactic components. 
As I have illustrated the hub of modulated genes whilst the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I came by the idea of working on spliced variants of transcriptomes that may contribute to the progression of CIN.
